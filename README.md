## 🧠 What's This Repo About?

This is my **personal learning lab** for full-stack development, focusing on:

- 💻 **Frontend:** React, Vite, Create React App, HTML5, CSS3, Tailwind
- ⚙️ **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- 🛢️ **Database:** MongoDB (coming soon!)
- 📦 **Tooling:** GitHub, Netlify, Vercel, ESLint, Postman, VS Code

I’m not just building apps — I’m **building skills**.

> 📁 Every folder here is a **real project** made with purpose — from learning `useReducer`, to deploying full React apps with Tailwind, and creating backends with Express.

## 💡 Why This Repo Exists

I believe in **"learn by doing"**.

Rather than just tutorials, I’m:
- 🛠️ Building and breaking apps myself
- 🔁 Iterating on real feedback
- 🚀 Deploying projects publicly
- 📚 Documenting progress like a dev in production

This repo grows with **every concept I master**.
